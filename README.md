# proto-and-pubsub

## Goals

### Do something with proto
- [X] Define a proto spec
- [X] Get the proto spec to be generated into c# code
- [X] Figure out how serialization from proto works
- [X] Make some console app that accepts serialized proto and outputs deserialized object to json?
- [ ] How to make sharing the protospec.cs less jank

### Do something with pub sub
- [ ] Some simple proof of concept that shows it working.

### Put the two together
- [ ] pub serialized proto, sub reads and deserializes proto to json
